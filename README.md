# Page-View-Time-Series-Visualizer

This repo saves the fourth project to complete the Data Analysis course in FreeCodeCamp.org. This project is about a Time Series Visualizer in Python, with help of matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas libraries.

# Abstract 

For this project we will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. We will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help us understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
